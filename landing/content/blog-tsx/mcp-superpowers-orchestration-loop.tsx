      , we gave our agents bespoke &quot;superpowers&quot; through custom MCP
      tools. But as your agentic workforce grows, you face a new challenge:
      <strong>The Orchestration Crisis</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      How do you ensure that your &quot;Security Agent&quot; and your
      &quot;DevOps Agent&quot; aren&apos;t stepping on each other&apos;s toes?
      How do they share context without bloating their individual context
      windows?
    </p>

    <h2>The Shared Intelligence Mesh</h2>

    <p>
      The Model Context Protocol isn&apos;t just about tools; it&apos;s about
      <strong>Shared Resources</strong>. By using ClawMore as a central hub, you
      create a Shared Intelligence Mesh where multiple specialized agents can
      subscribe to the same context streams.
    </p>

    <p>Imagine a workflow where:</p>

    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3">
      <li>
        <strong>The Auditor (Agent A)</strong> scans the repo using AIReady and
        flags a high-risk context cluster.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Architect (Agent B)</strong> reads that report via a shared
        MCP resource and designs a decoupling plan.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Coder (Agent C)</strong> executes the plan, using the
        Architect&apos;s context as a constraint.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Orchestration via MCP Resources</h2>

    <p>
      In the old world, you would have to pass massive JSON payloads between
      agents. With MCP, you pass <strong>URIs</strong>.
    </p>

    <div className="my-6 p-4 bg-slate-100 dark:bg-zinc-900 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm overflow-x-auto">
      <pre>
        {`// Agent C requests the decoupling plan from Agent B via MCP
const plan = await mcp.readResource("mcp://architect/plans/decouple-auth-v1");`}
      </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      This allows Agent C to stay &quot;lean.&quot; It only pulls in the
      specific parts of the plan it needs for the current file it is editing.
      The rest of the plan stays in the &quot;Intelligence Mesh,&quot; available
      on demand.
    </p>

    <h2>The ClawFlow Advantage</h2>

    <p>
      At <strong>ClawMore</strong>, we&apos;ve built this orchestration directly
      into our event-driven backbone (ClawFlow). Using AWS EventBridge and MCP,
      we coordinate swarms of specialized agents that move in sync.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Agent A finishes its audit, it emits a{' '}
      <code>ContextClusterFound</code>
      event. This event triggers Agent B to start its planning phase. The entire
      loop is autonomous, observable, and—most importantly—safe.
    </p>

    <h2>The Future of Work is Swarms</h2>

    <p>
      Single, general-purpose binary agents are a dead end. They are too
      expensive to run and too prone to hallucination at scale. The future
      belongs to
      <strong>Swarms of Specialists</strong> connected by a universal protocol.
    </p>

    <p>
      By adopting MCP today, you aren&apos;t just fixing your current prompts;
      you are building the infrastructure for the autonomous workforce of
      tomorrow.
