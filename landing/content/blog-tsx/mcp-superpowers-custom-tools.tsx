      , we saw how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) gives agents
      &quot;self-awareness&quot; of the codebase. But what if your agent needs
      more than just code? What if it needs to check your production logs, query
      your customer database, or understand your proprietary business rules?
    </p>

    <p>
      This is where <strong>Custom MCP Tools</strong> come in. Instead of
      building a monolithic agent with thousand-line prompts, you build a
      modular toolkit. An agent wearing an MCP &quot;superpower belt&quot; can
      dynamically pull in the exact capability it needs for the task at hand.
    </p>

    <h2>The Power of Domain-Specific Tools</h2>

    <p>
      The generic AI of the past (GPT-3/4) had to be told everything in the
      prompt. The agentic AI of the future (powered by MCP) uses tools to
      discover the truth.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <strong>ClawMore</strong>, we use custom MCP tools to bridge the gap
      between our serverless infrastructure and our agentic reasoning engine.
      Here are three categories of tools every engineering team should build:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>The Observer</strong>: Tools that query CloudWatch, Datadog, or
        Sentry. When an agent sees an error, it doesn&apos;t guess—it queries
        the logs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Archivist</strong>: Tools that search your internal Wiki,
        Jira, or Confluence. The agent understands the <em>reason</em> behind a
        decision, not just the code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Operator</strong>: Tools that safely interact with your
        internal APIs. An agent can check the status of a deployment or the
        health of a staging environment.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Building Your First Custom Server</h2>

    <p>
      Building an MCP server is surprisingly simple. It&apos;s a standard
      JSON-RPC interface. Using the MCP SDK, you can expose a set of Node.js
      functions as tools that any compliant agent (like Claude Code or Cline)
      can use.
    </p>

    <div className="my-6 p-4 bg-slate-100 dark:bg-zinc-900 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm overflow-x-auto">
      <pre>
        {`// Example: A tool that queries a proprietary database
server.addTool({
  name: "query_docs",
  description: "Search internal architectural documentation",
  parameters: {
    query: { type: "string" }
  },
  execute: async ({ query }) => {
    return await searchVectorStore(query);
  }
});`}
      </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      The magic happens when you register these tools. Your agent now has a
      <code>query_docs</code> command in its brain. It uses it only when it
      needs to clarify a requirement.
    </p>

    <h2>ClawMore: The Ultimate Tool Hub</h2>

    <p>
      ClawMore is designed to be the central hub for your agentic tools. By
      deploying your MCP servers on AWS using ClawMore, you give your agents a
      secure, scalable environment to operate.
    </p>

    <p>
      We use <strong>IAM-based security</strong> to ensure agents can only
      access the tools they are authorized to use. No more leaked API keys in
      prompts.
    </p>

    <h2>The Future is Modular</h2>

    <p>
      Stop building monolithic agents. Start building a{' '}
      <strong>Universal Intelligence Mesh</strong>. When you build a tool once
      as an MCP server, every agent in your company—from the smallest CI runner
      to the most complex autonomous architect—gets that superpower instantly.
